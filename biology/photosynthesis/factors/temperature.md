As temperature increases below the [[optimum temperature]], rate of photosynthesis also increases at an increasing rate.

At the [[optimum temperature]], the rate of photosynthesis is at its fastest.

Above the [[optimum temperature]], rate of reaction begins to decline and eventually becomes 0: no more photosynthesis reactions can be catalyzed.
