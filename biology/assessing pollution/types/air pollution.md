**Lichen** (that grow on **trees** and **buildings**) can be used as an indicator species for air pollution

This is due to the fact that lichens are **highly sensitive to sulfur dioxide concentrations** in their environment

  - Sulfur dioxide is one of the air pollutants released from **car exhausts** and **power stations** (i.e. during the combustion of fossil fuels)

The **abundance** (number) and **type** of lichen species growing at a particular location can be monitored to determine **how clean the air is**

- For example, a **high abundance** of lichen indicates **clean air**

- In particular, a high abundance of **bushy lichen** indicates **very clean air** (as these lichens need cleaner air than **crusty lichen**)

Another indicator species for air pollution is **blackspot fungus**, which grows on **rose leaves**
Like lichen, it is also sensitive to sulphur dioxide concentrations and **its presence indicates clean air**
