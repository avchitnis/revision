**solar system**
- 1 star (Sun)
- 8 planets
- natural satellites (moons)
- 5 dwarf planets (more?)
- 1000s of comets
- 1 000 000s of asteroids

**comets**
a chunk of ice or rock originating from the outer solar system,
often accompanied by a coma and tail.

**asteroids**
a rock that [[orbits]] generally between Mars and Jupiter.
sometimes asteroids get bounced towards Earth.

**gravity**
factors which affect a planet's gravity:
- mass
- radius
- density

$$gravitational \: \: field \: \: strength ∝ \frac{mass}{radius^2}$$


**red - shift**
light observed from distant galaxies is at a longer wavelength

more noticeable in galaxies further away from us

greater speed of galaxy = greater red - shift

∴ universe is expanding
