**nebula**
- a star forms from massive clouds of dust and gas in space, also known as a nebula
- nebulae are mostly composed of hydrogen
- gravity begins to pull the dust and gas together

**protostar**
- as the mass falls together it gets hot
- a star is formed when it is hot enough for the hydrogen nuclei to fuse together to make helium
- the fusion process releases energy, which keeps the core of the star hot

**main sequence star**
- the star is in equilibrium and is said to be stable
- the force of gravity holding the star together is balanced by higher pressure due to the high temperatures
- the sun is at this stable phase in its life

**red giant star**
- all the hydrogen has been used up in the fusion process
- takes several billion years
- larger nuclei begin to form
- star may expand to become a red giant

**white dwarf**
- all nuclear reactions are over
- small star such as the sun may begin to contract under pull of gravity
- in this instance, star becomes a white dwarf
- fades and changes colour as it cools

**supernova**
- a large star with more mass will continue making nuclear reactions 
- gets hotter and expands
- collapses suddenly and causes a gigantic explosion called a supernova
- at the center, a dense body called a neutron star forms
- an exploding supernova ejects hot dust and gases (nebulae) into space

**neutron star**
- the core of a supernova
- most massive stars: neutron star may collapse under gravity to form a black hole

**black hole**
- extremely dense point in space that not even light can escape from
