It is possible to use the **presence** or **absence** of particular organisms as an indicator of **pollution**

For example, some organisms are **particularly sensitive** to certain changes in their environment

- This means they can be studied in order to determine the **effect of human activities** on a particular **habitat** or **ecosystem**

- These organisms are known as **indicator species**

Indicator species can be used to determine the level of:
- [[water pollution]]
- [[air pollution]]

Here is an [[evaluation]] of the use of indicator species.
