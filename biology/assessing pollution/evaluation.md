Although using indicator species is a fairly **simple** and **cost-effective** method of determining whether a habitat is polluted or not, it has some **drawbacks**

- For example, it **can't give accurate numerical (quantitative) figures** for exactly **how much** pollution is present

- In addition, the **presence** or **absence** of indicator species can also be **affected by factors other than pollution** (e.g. the presence of predators or disease)

If more detailed information on pollution levels is required, **non-living indicators can be used instead**. For example:

- **Dissolved oxygen meters** and **chemical tests** can be used to very accurately determine the concentration of **dissolved oxygen in the water** and can be used to show **changes** in levels of water pollution **over time**

- **Electronic meters** and **laboratory tests** can be used to very accurately determine the concentration of **sulfur dioxide in the air** and can be used to show **changes** in levels of air pollution **over time**
