$$s = \frac{d}{t}$$
as radius increases, orbital speed decreases.

$$Î” \: \: KE = work \: \:done = force \times distance$$
x is perpendicular to F so work done is 0

**highly elliptical orbits**
communication near the poles

**polar orbits**
satellite will eventually pass over all parts of the Earth

**circular geostationary orbits**
remain over one point
used for broadcasting
travel at 3070ms<sup>-1</sup>

**low earth orbits**
require least fuel for launching satellites
travel at 7500ms<sup>-1</sup>
