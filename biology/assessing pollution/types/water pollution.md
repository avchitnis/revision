One form of water pollution occurs when **raw sewage** or **fertilizers** (both containing **nitrates**) are released into a body of water, such as a stream or pond

- This causes **microorganisms** in the water to **increase in number**. 

- As these microorganisms **respire**, they **use up the oxygen** in the water

Some invertebrate species, such as **stonefly larvae** and **freshwater shrimps**, are **highly sensitive** to the **concentration of dissolved oxygen** in the water they are living in

This makes them good indicator species for water pollution

- For example, the **presence** of stonefly larvae in a stream or river indicates that the water is **not polluted** (i.e. it is **clean** and has **high oxygen levels**)

On the other hand, some other invertebrate species are **adapted to live in polluted environments**

- This also makes them good indicator species for water pollution

- For example, the presence of **blood worms** and **sludge worms** in a body of water indicates a **very high level of water pollution**
