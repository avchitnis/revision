**Quadrats**
A quadrat is a square piece of wire that can be used to estimate the size of a population in a habitat.
- Population size in a habitat: random sampling
- Effect of an abiotic factor: systematic sampling ([[belt transects]])

| abundance               | total population<br>simply count the number of individuals in a quadrat                                                         | only works for large organisms distinguishable as individuals and do not move fast<br>(not always easy e.g. grass) |
| percentage cover        | quadrat is divided into 100 smaller squares<br>percentage cover is simply the number of squares filled with the species         | useful for organisms that grow as a flat covering e.g. grass, moss, lichen                                         |
| percentage<br>frequency | e.g. daisies in a field <br>quadrat is divided into 100 smaller squares <br>1 if the organism is present else 0 if it is absent | gives an indication of the frequency of the species<br>does not give the total population                          |
